This project contains a simple JHipster (6.10.5) generated app (monolith, angular, h2 for dev
and Postgres for prod), without any entity imported, for testing all configurations for:

1. Openshift (CRC - Code Ready Cluster),
2. Kubernetes Cluster,
3. Kubernetes Cluster with Helm,
4. Kubernetes Cluster with Ingress

All configuration yaml files and scripts are in another github project:
